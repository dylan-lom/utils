# djl-utils

*nix-style utilities

## Goals

* A collection of simple, self-explanitory CLI tools that follow *nix
  conventions.
* Statically compilable
* Standalone applications -- if only one tool is required the source code for
  that tool alone need be distributed.

## Tools

* **confirm**: Prompt user for confirmation and report response via exit code
* **line**: Extract line(s) from stdin
* **suptime**: System uptime in terms of seconds, minutes, hours or days
* **timestamp**: Current date-timestamps in common formats
* **truthy**: Test if input is true-adjacent

## Notes

I'm using this to self-teach the basics of C. The code is not "good" and
likely has some bugs.
